'''Key:21
I get 2 from History and 1 from Evolution in problem file.
You can easily decrypt using below code, this code is for encyption and decryption also.
So you have to give negative value for decryption and positive value for encryption.
Like in this question we have key 21 and we have to decrypt so we give -21 as a shift value.

#Code
print("Enter the word to be deciphered = ")
lines = []
while True:
    line = input()
    if line:
        lines.append(line)
    else:
        break
b = '\n'.join(lines)
shift=int(input("Enter shift value="))
l1=[]
l2=[]
for i in b:
    l1.append(ord(i))
for x in l1:
    if 64<x<91:
        if x+shift >90:
            x=x+shift-26
            l2.append(x)
        elif x+shift<65:
            x = x + shift + 26
            l2.append(x)
        else:
            l2.append(x+shift)
    elif 96<x<123:
        if x+shift >122:
            x=x+shift-26
            l2.append(x)
        elif x+shift<97:
            x = x + shift + 26
            l2.append(x)
        else:
            l2.append(x+shift)
    else:
        l2.append(x)
for c in l2:
    print(chr(c),end="")

Answer-The Raven
-BY EDGAR ALLAN POE
Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, Over many a
quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore— While I nodded, nearly napping,
suddenly there came a tapping, As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my
chamber door. “’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber
door— Only this and nothing more.”
Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December; And each
separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. Eagerly I wished
the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore— For the rare and radiant maiden whom
the angels name Lenore— Nameless here for evermore.
