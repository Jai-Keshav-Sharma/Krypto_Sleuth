"DECRYPTED MESSAGE"[PLAIN TEXT]:-

Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak And weary, .Over many a quaint And
curious volume of forgotten lore— While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a
tapping, As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my  chamber door. " 'Tis some visitor", 
I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door— Only this and nothing more."

Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December; And each separate dying ember 
wrought its ghost upon the floor. Eagerly I wished  the morrow; -- vainly I had sought to 
borrow. From my books surcease of sorrow-sorrow for the lost Lenore- For the rare and
radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore--Nameless here for evermore.
